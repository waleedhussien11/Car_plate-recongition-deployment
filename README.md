# Car Plate Recognition Project

## Introduction
This project implements a car plate recognition system using YOLOv8 for plate detection and EasyOCR for number plate text extraction. The system is deployed using Streamlit.

## Installation
. **Clone this repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/waleedhussien11/Car_plate-recongition-deployment.git
   cd Car_plate-recongition-deployment
   ```




## Usage
1. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Upload an image containing a car with a visible license plate.**
   - The app will detect the license plate and display the extracted text.

## Results
Our model achieved an accuracy of 98% on a test dataset of car images.
